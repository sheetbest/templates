This was overwhelming for our team and end users since it was challenging to track requests and notify users when their issue had presumably been resolved.<br /><br />        We were trying to streamline the receipt and management of user-reported technical issues.<br /><br />        We built a Helpdesk function into the PWA that allows users to submit an issue to our Admin team. The tickets are stored via Sheet Best where they can be assigned by our team and remediated.<br /><br />        What makes Sheet Best stand out is its price, integration with Google Sheets, simplicity.",

They can send and get data from Google sheets, this feature transform to a rich conversation with users.<br /><br />        What makes Sheet Best stand out is the documentation and the % of uptime.
